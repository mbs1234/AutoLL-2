/**
 * Learning the real drop schedule from what the poller sees.
 *
 * The hardcoded drop times in src/api/data/wdw.ts are maintained by hand from
 * third-party reports, and the best of those sources bucket their observations
 * to five minutes. Autopilot, meanwhile, is already watching the tipboard at
 * up to one-second resolution whenever it runs. Recording the moments
 * availability actually appears -- and, crucially, *when the poller was
 * looking* -- lets the schedule be checked and corrected from first-hand
 * evidence rather than trusted.
 *
 * Two signals count as a drop:
 *  - an attraction goes from unavailable to available;
 *  - its earliest offered return time jumps *earlier* by a meaningful amount,
 *    which is what a release of new inventory does to the tipboard even when
 *    the attraction was already available.
 *
 * Coverage is recorded alongside events so that "never observed at 15:47" is
 * only ever claimed for days on which the poller was actually running at 15:47.
