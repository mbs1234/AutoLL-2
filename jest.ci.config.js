/**
 * CI test config: the base config minus the suites that are already broken in
 * pristine upstream `mickey`.
 *
 * Upstream ships a red test suite at f1f022a. Verified by running the suite in
 * a clean worktree of upstream/mickey: 8 suites / 11 tests fail there, and the
 * same 8 suites fail on this fork. `src/api/ll.test.ts` additionally could
 * not even load upstream, because its Disneyland block imported the
 * unpublished `./diu` module; that block went with Disneyland support, and
 * the ~27 stale failures in the Walt Disney World half remain. (Example:
 * `experiences()` expects `data.availableExperiences`, which the test's
 * mocked response no longer provides.)
 *
 * Gating CI on the full suite would make it permanently red and therefore
 * useless as a signal. Excluding these makes CI meaningful again: anything new
 * that breaks -- including in code this fork adds -- shows up immediately.
 *
 * These are excluded because they are ALREADY failing, not to hide new
 * breakage. Run `npm test` for the unfiltered picture. If upstream repairs a
 * suite (or we do), delete it from this list.
